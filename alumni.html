				I was involved with the Roosevelt Institute at UGA and the national Roosevelt Institute Campus Network all four years of undergrad. Through the organization, students and faculty mentors taught me the basics of policy writing and introduced me to clinical research as I introduced a breastfeeding policy to Athens Regional Hospital. This policy-based skill set has afforded me opportunities to participate in building the nation's newborn screening clearinghouse with Genetic Alliance and to establish guidelines for rare disease testing in India with the Jain Foundation. Most importantly, I have met some truly inspirational millennials through the Roosevelt Institute who are collaborating toward effecting positive change in their communities--local, national and global, and they have supported me as I attempted to do the same. I am now a medical student at the University of Virginia. As I work toward greater involvement in global medicine and maternal and child health, I am constantly thankful for a handle on salient policy discourses and relationships with millennial change agents and community-building partners all over the country.

				Roosevelt was a foundational part of the transformational 4.5 years I spent at UGA. As a student member, a scholar in the class, board member, and TA, I made some of my deepest friendships at UGA and found a home for my intellectual development. I am currently a student in the University of Oxford's MPhil in Modern Middle Eastern Studies Program as a Rhodes Scholar. Two aspects of my Roosevelt experience continue to stand-out as experiences that shaped my current perspectives and skill sets. First was the opportunity that Roosevelt gave me to delve into the nitty gritty of policy work. By working on an early childhood education policy proposal that focused on Athens, I was exposed to the realities of working with a community and developing a policy proposal customized to a specific community. Secondly, Roosevelt was an amazing opportunity to talk with other extraordinarily brilliant and interesting students about topics about whichI knew relatively little. These conversations challenged me and informed me, and I continue to draw on the formal and informal conversations that I had with speakers and other club members today.
